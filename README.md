# Algolia assignment

This project describes two search use cases based on the data produced by the Algolia Search API and pre-aggregated by our Analytics API: 
* alternative searches
* trending searches

## Alternative searches

These instructions will allow you to run the notebook : 
* replace the path variable to the local location of the data  (path = "workspace/algolia/hn_insights_data/")
* download Elasticsearch (https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-6.5.1.tar.gz) and run bin/elasticsearch

## Trending searches

These instructions will allow you to run the notebook : 
* replace the path variable to the local location of the data  (path = "workspace/algolia/hn_insights_data/")
